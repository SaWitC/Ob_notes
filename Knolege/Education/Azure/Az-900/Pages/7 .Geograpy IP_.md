##### <span style="color:#35818e">Azure datacenters</span>
```
The physical infrastructure for Azure starts with datacenters. Conceptually, the datacenters are the same as large corporate datacenters. Theyâ€™re facilities with resources arranged in racks, with dedicated power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.
```

azure has a lot of datacenters however individual datacenter are not directly accessible 
Datacenters are grouped into azure regions or zones that are designed to help you achieve resiliency and reliability for  your business critical workloads.
##### <span style="color:#35818e">Availability Zones</span>
```
avilability zone are physicaly separated datacenters within an azure region. Each avilibility zone is maid up of one or more datacenters equiped with independent powerm cooling, and networking.
An avilibility zones is set up be an isolation boundary .if one zone goes down the other continues working. Availibility zones are conected throut high speed private fiber-optic networks
```

Usage
you want to ensure your services and data redundant so you can protect your information in case of failure. When you host infrastructure setting up you own redundancy requires that you can create duplicate hardware environments. azure can help to make you app highly available thruout Availability zones.

you can use zones to run to build hight-Availability to your app replicating in other Availability zones

Availability zones are primary for VMs managed disks, load balancers and SQL databases. Azure services that support availibility zones fall into three categories

- zonal services you pin the resource to a specific zone (for example you can shoose zone when create VMs, Managed disk, IP Addresses)
- Zone redundant services:  the platform replicates automatically across zones (for example, zone redundant storage, SQL Database).
- Non regional services:Services are always available from Azure geographies and are resilient to zone-wide outages as well as region-wide outages
Sometimes cloud can be to big so it impact multiple availibility zones in a single region
##### <span style="color:#35818e">Azure Regions</span>
```
Region it is a geographical area on the planet that contains at lerast one but potenialy multiple datacenters that are nearby and netwoked together with a loow latency network
```
when you deploy a resource group in azure you will often need to choose the region where you want you resources deployed.
##### <span style="color:#35818e">Azure Region pairs</span>
```
it is another layer of cloud redundancy that is designed to kepp servioces available even if one of regions in the pais fall down

Region Pair: Disaster recovery and resilience strategy with paired regions separated by at least 300 miles.
```
aditional advantages of region pairs:
- if an extensive azure outage occurs one region out of every pair is prioritized yo make sure at least one is restored as quickly as possible for applications hosted in that region pair
- planed region updates are rolled out to paired refgions one regions at a time tyo minimase downtime and risks
- Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for brazil south)

#### Data center (building block of global azure infrastructure)
1. physical facility
2. Hosting for group of networked servers
3. Own power cooling & networking infrastructure
#### Region
1. geographical area on the planet
2. one but ussualy more datacenters conected with low-latency network (<2ms)
3. Location for your services
4. Some services are available only in certain regions
5. some services are global services such are not assigned/deployed in specific region
6. Globaly available with 50+ regions
7. special government region (US, DoD Us Gov Virginia, etc)
8. Special partnered regions (China East, China North)
to choose the best region it is possible to use https://azurespeedtest.azurewebsites.net/ 
but not all services available in all regions to check services availability you can use microsoft site to check
#### Availability zone
[[Geography.canvas|Untitled]]
1. Regional feature
2.  grouping of physically separated facilities
3. Designed to protect from data center failures
4. if zone goes down other continue working
![[Pasted image 20240708142407.png]]

Two service categories
1. Zonal services (VM, Disks, etc) (it is possible to create two different availability zones  and in case if one of zones fall down VM that is placed in a different zone can still work)
   A resource can be deployed to a specific, self-selected availability zone to achieve more stringent latency or performance requirements. Resiliency is self-architected by replicating applications and data to one or more zones within the region. Resources are aligned to a selected zone. For example, virtual machines, managed disks, or standard IP addresses can be aligned to a same zone, which allows for increased resiliency by having multiple instances of resources deployed to different zones.
2. Zone redundant services (SQL, Storage, etc) **Zone-redundant services**: Resources are replicated or distributed across zones automatically. For example, zone-redundant services replicate the data across multiple zones so that a failure in one zone doesn't affect the high availability of the data.
- Not all regions are supported
- Supported regions has three or more zones
- A zone is one or more data centers. 
#### Region pairs 
 If region level fails there are region pair (beetwen two regions that are related at least 300 miles away from each other this distance is enought to cover natural level disasters like storms,floods, earthquakes )
-  Each region is paired with another region
- Region pairs are static and can not be chosen
- Each pair resides within the same geography (exception is brazil south)
- Physical isolation with at leas 300 miles distance (when possible)
- some service have platform provided replication
- planned updates across the pairs (when some updates are applied to the first region and it working the the same update roole up to the another region)
