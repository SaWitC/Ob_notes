**HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol)**
The **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load webpages using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack.

---
**HTTPS**
Secure version of HTTP use TLS or SSL to encrypt the data
- HTTPS is used for secure communication over the web.
- Ensures secure data transmission between a web browser and a web server.
- Encrypts data to protect it from interception and tampering.
- Works in a request-response model.
- Clients (web browsers) send requests to servers, and servers send back responses.

**TCP** (transmission control protocol)
is **a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network**. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks.

---
**UDP**
s **a communications protocol for time-sensitive applications like gaming, playing videos, or Domain Name System (DNS) lookups**. UDP results in speedier communication because it does not spend time forming a firm connection with the destination before transferring the data.

**SMTP** (Simple mail Transfer protocol)
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is **a technical standard for transmitting electronic mail (email) over a network**. Like other networking protocols, SMTP allows computers and servers to exchange data regardless of their underlying hardware or software.

- used for sending and receiving email messages between server
- Usually works with other protocols like POP3 or IMAP for retrieving emails.
- Plain smtp is not secure
- Uses TLS of SSL for secure
---
**HTTPS VS SMTP**
- **SMTP**: Transfers plain text messages formatted according to specific standards (e.g., RFC 5321 for SMTP).
- **HTTPS**: Transfers various types of web content, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other multimedia files, all encrypted using SSL/TLS

- **SMTP**: Can be secured using STARTTLS or SMTPS to encrypt email data in transit.
- **HTTPS**: Always uses SSL/TLS to ensure data encryption and secure communication channels.
